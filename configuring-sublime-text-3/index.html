<p>Some days ago I stumbled across <a href="http://www.caniswitchtosublimetext3.com/">this website</a>, which checks if your installed Sublime plugins are compatible with Sublime Text 3. As all of mine were already compatible I made the switch. Nevertheless I had to spend some time migrating, because there are some differences in setting up Sublime’s snippets and SublimeLinter.</p>
<h2 id="disabling-default-snippets">Disabling default snippets</h2>
<p>By default Sublime has some snippets installed that you may find useful. Personally I like to use my own, therefore I disable the pre-installed ones. In Sublime Text 2 this could be done by deleting the snippets from the <code>Packages</code> folder. Unfortunately updates reverted those changes.</p>
<p>Sublime Text 3 handles its internal snippets differently. They are now stored directly as bundled packages inside of the main app, but can be overwritten by adding a snippet with the same name in the Packages folder. To extract all snippets of a language there is a package called <strong>PackageResourceViewer</strong>, which is available in Package Control. Simply install the package, search for the “PackageResourceViewer: Extract Package” command and choose the language with the snippets you want to edit or disable.</p>
<p>All files inside this package will now be copied to your Packages folder: <code>~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/</code>. Now you can edit the pre-installed snippets and completions by opening files with the extensions <code>.sublime-snippet</code> or <code>.sublime-completions</code>. Sometimes there are also some completions stored as python files, for example <code>css_completions.py</code>.</p>
<p>If you simply want to disable the default auto-completions, open these files and remove all content. Empty files are evaluated as if there is no snippet/completion. To benefit from future updates, I recommend deleting all other files that have been extracted to your Packages folder, as these are language definitions and settings.</p>
<h2 id="sublimelinter3">SublimeLinter3</h2>
<p>I use SublimeLinter for JavaScript programming. Its latest update, which only works with Sublime Text 3, has some major changes. The main package does now operate as a framework for different linters and each linter has its own package in Package Control.</p>
<p>To use jshint you have to install the <strong>SublimeLinter</strong> and <strong>SublimeLinter-jshint</strong> package. <a href="https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-jshint">SublimeLinter-jshint</a> requires <code>node</code> and <code>jshint</code> to be installed globally. If you use <code>zsh</code> and <code>nvm</code> like I do, you’ll also have to add your current node version to your PATH in a .zshenv file, e.g. <code>export PATH=$PATH:/Users/max/.nvm/v0.10.26/bin</code>. Otherwise SublimeLinter won’t find jshint. There also is a path setting for different operating systems in the new <code>SublimeLinter.sublime-settings</code> file, but adding the path there didn’t work for me.</p>
