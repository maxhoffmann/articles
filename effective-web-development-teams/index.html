<p>Some days ago I stumbled across the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">&quot;Joel Test&quot;</a> for software teams by Joel Stolsky, which includes 12 steps to better code. His post inspired me to write my own test especially for web development teams as I think it differs in some points. This may also be handy during interviews when itâ€™s your turn to ask questions.</p>
<h2 id="answer-these-questions-with-yes-or-no-">Answer these questions with &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do you use version control?</li>
<li>Do you start projects with prototypes?</li>
<li>Do you have daily meetings?</li>
<li>Do you have an up-to-date schedule?</li>
<li>Do you have a database for bugs and issues?</li>
<li>Do you write automated tests?</li>
<li>Do you use a build process for front-end and back-end?</li>
<li>Do you write open source software?</li>
<li>Do you support side projects?</li>
<li>Do you have a budget for training or conferences?</li>
</ol>
<p>Give your team 1 point for each &quot;yes&quot; answer. 10 points are perfect. 8 and 9 a great. If you have 7 points and below ask yourself why you had to answer questions with &quot;no&quot; and if you could change that.</p>
