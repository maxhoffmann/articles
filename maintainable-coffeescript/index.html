<h1 id="maintainable-coffeescript">Maintainable CoffeeScript</h1>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I didn’t switch to CoffeeScript. Blog post may follow soon.</p>
<p>In 2012 I decided to master JavaScript. I started with Addy Osmani’s free <a href="http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/">&quot;Learning JavaScript Design Patterns&quot;</a>, read <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do">&quot;JavaScript: The Good Parts&quot;</a> by Douglas Crockford, then went on with <a href="http://effectivejs.com">&quot;Effective JavaScript&quot;</a> by David Herman, learned about <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025245.do">&quot;Maintainable JavaScript&quot;</a> from Nicholas Zakas and am currently half through <a href="http://jsninja.com/">&quot;Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja&quot;</a> by John Resig and Bear Bibeault. I also had a glimpse into <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">&quot;Eloquent JavaScript&quot;</a> by Marijn Haverbeke and <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/object-oriented-javascript/book">&quot;Object Oriented JavaScript&quot;</a> by Stoyan Stefanov. Each one of these books is a fantastic resource and helped me enormously to enhance my JavaScript knowledge. I already have another book on my reading list: <a href="http://tddjs.com/">&quot;Test-Driven JavaScript Development&quot;</a> by Christian Johansen.</p>
<p>While learning to avoid the quirks of JavaScript I started to value its good parts and then felt in love with the expressiveness of the language. Having written some web applications without and with frameworks like <a href="http://angularjs.org">Angular.js</a>, I got aware of the boilerplate code one has to write though. Class inheritance is pretty painful without a library and some things like type or existence checking isn’t fun.</p>
<p>Fortunately the next version of ECMAScript has evolved to a very powerful and beautiful standard, which will definitely have a huge influence on how we write JavaScript. Combined with Web Components web site and application development will be very different in one or two years—hopefully sooner than later.</p>
<p>Until the standard has been implemented in most browsers we can use <em>compile-to-javascript</em> languages like <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, which allow us to use some of the ES6 features today. I’ve looked into CoffeeScript before, but I never felt that I was ready for it. I had to learn JavaScript first. This week I stumbled again on CoffeeScript when <a href="http://aseemk.com/talks/intro-to-coffeescript">these slides</a> by Aseem Kishore made the round on twitter. CoffeeScript itself influenced the new standard and provides some syntactical improvements. I have been playing around with it lately and really like to use arrow functions, class inheritance and splats today, but I think CoffeeScript is too lax when it comes to omitting braces and keywords. Maybe this is just because I’m not used to read it, but as I use CoffeeScript just in the interim until ES6 is useable I defined some conventions I want to share. These should make it easier to read and maintain the code especially for JS developers without a lot of CoffeeScript experience (myself included). On CoffeeScript’s website it says: <em>“The golden rule of CoffeeScript is: It’s just JavaScript.”</em> My conventions try to make CoffeeScript’s syntax more like JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="code-conventions">Code Conventions</h2>
<h2 id="1-always-wrap-function-parameters-in-parentheses">1. always wrap function parameters in parentheses</h2>
<p>Readability is important. Without parentheses it’s hard to see where functions are called—even for syntax highlighters like <a href="http://prismjs.com/">prism.js</a>. It’s also inconsistent as one has to use parantheses calling functions without parameters.</p>
<h3 id="without-parentheses">without parentheses</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-coffeescript">request = new XMLHttpRequest
  request.responseType = type
  request.onload = handleResponse
  request.open method, url, true
  request.setRequestHeader &#39;X-Requested-With&#39;, &#39;XMLHttpRequest&#39;
  request.send()
</code></pre>
<h3 id="with-parentheses">with parentheses</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-coffeescript">request = new XMLHttpRequest()
  request.responseType = type
  request.onload = handleResponse
  request.open(method, url, true)
  request.setRequestHeader(&#39;X-Requested-With&#39;, &#39;XMLHttpRequest&#39;)
  request.send()
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can see on the first sight which parts of the code are assignments and which ones are function calls.</p>
<h2 id="2-always-write-return-if-you-intend-to-do-so">2. always write return if you intend to do so</h2>
<p>CoffeeScript always returns the last statement of a function. This leads to lines with just a variable name, but lines with just a variable name could also be part of an array for example. It’s also not explicit if you return early. Look at the last line. In my opinion it looks unintentional.</p>
<h3 id="without-return">without return</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-coffeescript">getVar = (para) -&gt;
  context = this or window
  if not /^\&#39;/g.test(para)
    return context[para]
  para
</code></pre>
<h3 id="with-return">with return</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-coffeescript">getVar = (para) -&gt;
  context = this or window
  if not /^\&#39;/g.test(para)
    return context[para]
  return para
</code></pre>
<h2 id="3-wrap-functions-which-are-not-the-last-argument-in-parentheses">3. wrap functions which are not the last argument in parentheses</h2>
<p>Without parantheses and the return statement this looks like a syntax error to me. Apparently this is also hard to understand for CoffeeScript’s compiler as this syntax isn’t valid when compiled with the new <a href="http://michaelficarra.github.io/CoffeeScriptRedux/">CoffeeScript Redux compiler</a>. The Redux compiler is also smart enough not to wrap the function in parentheses when compiled.</p>
<h3 id="without-parentheses">without parentheses</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-coffeescript">func = string.split(&#39;.&#39;).reduce (obj,i) -&gt;
  obj[i] or false
, obj
</code></pre>
<h3 id="with-parentheses">with parentheses</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-coffeescript">func = string.split(&#39;.&#39;).reduce( ((obj,i) -&gt;
    return obj[i] or false
), obj)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="4-wrap-objects-in-curly-braces">4. wrap objects in curly braces</h2>
<p>This again fights inconsistency. Arrays have to be wrapped in braces so should objects.</p>
<h3 id="without-braces">without braces</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-coffeescript">obj =

<h2 id="why-should-i-use-more-parentheses-">Why should I use more parentheses?</h2>
<p>CoffeeScript allows me to write JavaScript with some of ES6’s features today and JavaScript’s syntax has parentheses. I still want to write JavaScript and when ES6 is out I’ll switch back. I also think that omitting everything CoffeeScript allows is more error-prone and not good for maintainability. Another factor is readability, which suffers from a too lax syntax. Brendan Eich proposed a <a href="http://brendaneich.com/2010/11/paren-free/">syntax for ES6</a> with less parentheses for conditions and loops, which combines the advantages of both styles in my opinion.</p>
<p>If you want to write CoffeeScript, learn JavaScript first. For beginners I recommend <a href="http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/">&quot;Effective JavaScript&quot;</a>. Afterwards read <a href="http://jsninja.com/">&quot;Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja&quot;</a> and the most important thing: write JavaScript—a lot. If you feel that you are ready to move on take a look at CoffeeScript’s documentation <strong>and</strong> at real world code. The example pseudo code is far away from the code you’ll write. Real CoffeeScript looks more like <a href="https://github.com/heelhook/chardin.js/blob/master/chardinjs.coffee">this</a>. If you have learned JavaScript properly the transition to CoffeeScript will be quick and easy.</p>
<p>I can not wait for the next version of JavaScript and CoffeeScript is a foretaste of what’s to come. ECMAScript.next has powerful features like modules, Proxies, Weakmaps etc. which will make JavaScript more beaufitul and powerful than ever before.</p>
